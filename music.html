<h1>Musics and<br>influence</h1>


<p1 style="text-align: centre;">Queen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis, and Yes,[330] with Mercury also inspired by the rock and roll singers Little Richard,[331] Elvis Presley[332] and the gospel singer Aretha Franklin.[333] On the Beatles, Brian May stated they "built our bible as far as musical composition, arrangement and production went. The White Album is a complete catalogue of how you should use a studio to build songs."[334] Mercury said, "John Lennon was larger than life, and an absolute genius. Even at a very early stage when they were the Beatles, I always preferred John Lennon's things. I don't know why. He just had that magic."[332] May and Mercury were influenced by Jimi Hendrix, with Mercury saying "he really had everything any rock 'n' roll star should have",[335] and May saying "Jimi is, of course, my number one. And I've always said that [...] I never stop learning from Jimi."[336] Mercury's thesis for his Ealing College degree was on Hendrix, and Mercury and Taylor closed their Kensington Market stall on 18 September 1970 to commemorate his death.</p1>
